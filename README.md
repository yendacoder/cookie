# Cookie for Discuit

Cookie is a lurker-friendly mobile client for the [Discuit](https://discuit.net) social platform written with Flutter SDK.

## why cookie?

The app was started as Biscuit first but then got renamed because of a confilct with another Discuit client app.

## where to try it?

Alpha and beta releases will only be available as an apk Android releases on GitHub. First full release will be published on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/). After that we will review the plans and decide whether to publish on PlayStore. There are no immediate plans to publish the iOS version, but we are putting an effort into supporting iOS, including full iOS UI style (for example, by using [flutter_platform_widgets](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_platform_widgets) package). You should be able to download the code and build it for your device at any point. Given enough demand, the official AppStore release is very likely.
Web and desktop applications are unlikely, but not ruled out completely.

## what is "lurker-friendly"?

The app is intended to be a full-featured client, but we will give a higher priority to the features related to content consuming, rather than posting and community management. That might be especially apparent during the early development days.

## can I steal the code?

You are free to fork as long as you are keeping it open source. [Check the full license (AGPL v3)](https://github.com/yendacoder/cookie/blob/main/LICENSE).

## where can I see what features are in development?

Currently, nowhere ðŸ¤·. The roadmap and issue tracking will be set up eventually on GitHub.

## choice of libraries and state management approach

All current architectural decisions have been made with the only intention to produce a usable MVP application as quickly as possible. No choices are final and might change soon enough.

## I have a feature request

It is possible to influence development priorities, for example by posting on Discuit. Note though, that until we at least reach feature parity with the website, most desirable features are obvious enough.

## how to help?

The best thing you can do is star the repository on GitHub and join the community on Discuit. The more exposure we get, the faster development will go.
If you'd like to make code contributions, please wait for a few weeks until we have a more stable basic code structure.

## supporting otherwise

If you want to go an extra mile, please support the Discuit platform itself and Previnder personally. Success of the platform directly impacts the future of this app.
